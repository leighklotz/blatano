# GPT-J-6B

I used https://6b.eleuther.ai/ from Eleuther AI to continue the introduction of Blatano.

It came up with two good product ideas and a few not so good ones.

1. "Minifig" mode
All Blatani could be shown as minifigs.  I had already thought of a list mode, but this
is a better story.  Also the word minifig, from Lego.

2. Travel Map
I can do no better than verbatim here:
```Here is a page from a notebook Blatano found on a computer. The drawing
illustrates the potential for Blatano to display a multitude of data
about the place of the computer in the landscape. Blatano displays
electronic data in a map-like way, and a note about a distant place
that is to be visited by a journeying voyager.```

3. Trinary button input eg/beg/say
As it says, an odd feature that uses some buttons and a strange three-position input.
The output seems to be poetry.

4. A new tagline
```You are "so small and far away" as your Blatano.
```

RESULT
Blatano is a mid-21st Century Modern inhabitant of the boundary
between our physical and digital space. It knows only what it senses
in the environment around it: it recognizes fellow digital denizens by
their electronic, radio, and digital trails. For our benefit, it shows
their names and their digital portraits.

Eschewing Dr. Seuss's "Thing 1, Thing 2" approach, Blatano uses a way
of naming entities that distills all its knowledge down into a few
bits of information, which it then further illustrates for us as a
drawing and a name.  The size of the drawing indicates the distance
from Blatano as well. Blatano also has a sense of location, and draws
its view of the radio horizon along the bottom of the display. The
drawings may not resemble you, your landscape, or your smart
refrigerator, but if you see a name and robot drawing consistently
associated with your presence, rest assured it is an accurate
representation of how Blatano perceives you.

In Rich Gold's "Little Computer People," we are outside the
computation, looking at the homunculus in the computer. With Blatano,
the homunculus is looking at us.

You are "so small and far away" as your Blatano.

This is Blatano!

Select the middle option if you want to turn off the name/digital
portrait view.

The minifig option offers a single of the drawing modes that Blatano
offers (see menu above right for these options).

Blatano has a few other odd features worth mentioning.

Here is a page from a notebook Blatano found on a computer. The drawing
illustrates the potential for Blatano to display a multitude of data
about the place of the computer in the landscape. Blatano displays
electronic data in a map-like way, and a note about a distant place
that is to be visited by a journeying voyager.

The language Blatano uses is an attempt to express the way in which
most of us have learned how to speak.

The sentences are short enough that they can be read from a short line
at the bottom of the display. (Blatano can also use its laser to print
onto the notebook, but this isn't the usual mode for displaying
something.)

[eg/beg/say/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/eg]

Translation:

	I think
	It's said
	That it is said
	I think

	[quit/nrn]

You can force Blatano to say certain things.

[eg/beg/say/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/beg/say/eg/say/eg]

Translation:

	I hope
	May be
	I hope

	[quit/nrn]

Press 'eg' and 'beg' a few times and Blatano will go into verb
conjugation mode.

[eg/beg/grn/grn/eg/beg/eg/beg/eg/grn/grn/eg/beg/beg/eg/eg/eg/be
